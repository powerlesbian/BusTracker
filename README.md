## On screen animation of what some motor vehicles may be doing

Description of project: Given that APIs have become such an integral part of programming, as long as the real-time data is available, it's possible to display this data in an animated and visually appealing way making information more friendly and usable by the average person. 


How to Run: Just load, click and run.  May require update to API token if its not running.  Please email me for support. 

Roadmap of future improvements: Other transportation provided that API is available.
